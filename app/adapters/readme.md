This folder (/adapters) has nothing to do with OOP design-patterns, but more with
the presentational aspect. The one and only point of Adapters is to obfuscate or at
least flatten / clean the database schema for the end user. Every Adapter inherits from
a practical base Adapter class that has handy functions to manipulate an object or an
array of objects quite quickly and simply.
